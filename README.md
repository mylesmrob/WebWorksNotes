Notes for How The Web Works:<br />
-Websites are stored on servers, either being retrieved by dynamic generation or
from the code that is currently stored.<br />
-Browsers are interpreters of the source code created for a website.<br />
-The address of a server is found through its IP, or internet protocol. When
attempting to access it, users do not have to type out the full address, but
instead the domain name, which is simpler and human readable.<br />
-A browser cannot instantly contact a server, for it must firt go through a
DNS server, which handles various domains, each with their own unique IP.<br />
-A request is when a browser sends a package of data when attempting to gain
access to a particular website and its functions. By opening developer tools
and its network tab, all the requests on your current browser can be seen.<br />
-A response is what is sent back to a browser from a website. Contains the
HTML code that must be read in order for things to work properly.<br />
-HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are three languages that allow for information to be
brought into action. These are some examples that are often regarded as the
"technologies involved."<br />
-HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, provides the structure of a website.<br />
-CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, provides style and detail.<br />
-JavaScript applies logic to the website's design and is in charge of handling
everything that takes place after the page itself has been loaded.<br />
-HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, handles the data transferred and ensures
that it is standardized.<br />
-HTTPS, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, is the same as HTTP, but in an
encrypted form. Most sites use this form.<br />
-Frameworks are packages of utility functions that give instructions on their
usage. These are often hidden to users that are simply visiting a page.<br />
-Mobile apps do not want HTML as a response, but instead looks for JSON, or
Javascript Object Notation.<br />
